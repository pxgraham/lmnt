When they choose to search for a game,
they get put in the search queue.

if there is already a person in the search queue,
you create a match in the match queue,
and the person that was searching for a game joins you.

When users disconnect or leave lobby/queue/game,
they are deleted from 'users'.
if they are in the lobby, they are deleted from the lobby.
if they are in the queue, they are deleted from the queue.

if they are in the queue and stop searching, they move back to the lobby.
if they are in a match, they are deleted from the match, 
and the opponent gets to choose whether to join the queue or lobby,
and afterwards the match gets deleted.
