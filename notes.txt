Were going to want to have mutiple players in a match. 
around like 5-10.
Players can choose whether they want to be fire, water, air, or earth
they all have one primary attack that shoots their element
they will also have another ability
possibly a dash or a roll

each player will have those 2 moves with their elements.

fire
water
earth
air

gain power after a takedown
